And selling simplistic slogans to the electorate is damaging as well.For example Trump promises to repeal ObamaCare which help 20 million poor American but never explained what he will replace it with unless he wants people to die.The same simplistic slogan of Brexit . Never explained what Leave means or lie about it.||Most of the liberals I've encountered in these past month are ant-democratic. I mean... Farron calls himself a liberal...||""Hold on to liberal values"" - or hold on to neoliberal values (government of the people, by the rich, for the corporations)?||I note that Mrs May was the tenth foreign leader that Trump telephoned after his election.

There are analogous dynamics driving support for Brexit and for Donald Trump, just as there are comparable weaknesses in the remain proposition and Hillary Clinton’s candidacy. But the relationship is more metaphorical than causal. That, in any case, is the sense in which American commentary has appropriated the term Brexit – shorthand for the punishment administered by angry voters to what they perceive as a corrupt, metropolitan establishment.</p> <p>But Brexit is not a metaphor in the UK, it is government policy. The election of Mr Trump does very little to make its passage smoother. It adds new layers of diplomatic complexity and economic uncertainty.

Race, you see, is an artificial construct, invented in the minds of racists and given material reality by their practice of racism.

So, yes, I can definitely understand how Ms Spektor comes to her position.

I watched in disbelief as they set fire to literally thousands of tyres in built up areas. What a strange place.
Sturgeon is a gem||The elephant in the room... who is going to say it?
Okay I will. Unionism - staunch, stubborn, backwards, Unionism. That's the problem in Northern Ireland. Old sectarians still fighting the war and fantasising about the good old days when the fenions knew their place. 
How is Northern Ireland ever going to move on, on anything including abortion, gay rights, and paramilitaries, when you have religious sectarianism embedded in stormont? The minister for education recently removed all references to the Irish language from the website after control went from sinn fein to the DUP. That's the level of pathetic we are taking about.
And, let's be honest, the unionists are still in charge. So until that changes expect little changes in Northern Ireland.||The list of decisions, beliefs, personnel, actions, ""ideas"", history which shames Stormont is hardly limited to its views on abortion. I'm ashamed they're part of the UK, ashamed that people who call themselves ""Loyalist"" think they are loyal to any kind of ideal that the rest of us grew out of 70 years ago.||The strange thing about gnus situation is, it's a portion of the Protestant Ulster Scotts (who claim such strong links to Britain via Scotland) who are against abortion in Northern Ireland, whilst the Catholics (who are traditionally against abortion due to the Vatican's stance on it) are in favour of bringing in a law allowing abortion in the six counties! So with the Scottish Parliament led by the (non-denominational) SNP offering to supply abortions free to women from NI, where exactly does that leave the loyalists loyalty? In tatters by the looks of it. And thus another pebble fell out of the wall that holds the Union together. Scotland with a re-joined Ireland will leave the UK and join Europe proper, fair thee well little England, and close the door behind you on your way out.||I think from now on we should accept that anything that 'enrages' the likes of the DUP is probably a Very Good Thing, and Sturgeon's proposal is just that.

. Independent polling published recently by Amnesty International showed that seven in 10 people want to see Northern Ireland’s harsh abortion laws changed, while more than half want to see abortion decriminalised altogether.

While hard right Unionists stay in government that's still a dream though it is clear that the Northern Irish establishment is fighting against the majority.",,2db84505-f885-46a3-bc0d-01f72e5b689e,,15,,,,,"<p>Scotland and Northern Ireland are separated by just a few short miles of sea. But when it comes to access to abortion, they are divided by more than 150 years of history. While Scots women are able to access abortions on the same basis as their counterparts in England and Wales, Northern Irish women still face a near-total ban on the termination of pregnancy.</p> <p>In 2014-15, only 16 women were able to have lawful abortions in Northern Ireland. By contrast, 833 Ulster women travelled to England or Wales and paid for terminations at private clinics. And despite being full and equal taxpayers, Northern Ireland-resident women have been barred from accessing free abortions in NHS hospitals in England, Wales and Scotland.</p>",Scotland’s offer to give abortions to Northern Irish women shames Stormont,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/21/scotland-abortions-northern-ireland-irish-nicola-sturgeon

The few additional seconds the kicker took was easily overlooked when you compare how their handling and excellent tactics were compared to the Welsh, they looked all over the shop and couldn't figure out that Japan weren't going to commit numbers to the ruck so had plenty to defend.The Welsh wouldn't have won but for that terrible forward pass decision in the first half when it looked likeJapan were on for a 100m try. If they don't book their ideas up they're going to be wooden spoon winners come the 6 nations!||Well played Japan. They are heading the right direction and are enjoyable to watch.
Cuthbert had a bit of a shocker.||I still bet Gatland will pick 11/15 Welsh players for the Lions.||First off - if i have to here Jiffy and Butler announcing everything a welshman does as 'brilliant' once more i'll scream.

So don't see Red Bull getting too involved unless one or both Mercedes run into trouble or mistakes.

And the thing is with global warming, not only is the outcome severe in the extreme, but the likelihood is very, very high that highly damaging impacts will occur.
According to the article Tail Risk vs. Alarmism, by Dr. Kerry Emanuel, the Cecil and Ida Green professor of atmospheric science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he has been on the faculty since 1981, we are on track to triple pre-industrial levels of atmospheric CO2 this century.
According to the IPCC graph supplied in the article that would give us a 5 percent chance of exceeding 6.75 degrees C above pre-industrial levels.
As Emanuel says in the article below:

http://climatechangenationalforum.org/tail-risk-vs-alarmism/||Seems likely that the tipping point has passed. We are also at the beginning of a mass extinction event.There was NEVER enough urgency, or cohesion, about addressing the issues of pollution, over population and climate instability, and the clock long since reached midnight.If Mr Trump holds to his views on this subject, it will be the latest tragic mistake in a very long line.||A reality TV celebrity declaring war on the earths' natural systems, the biosphere and all its' inhabitants..........will we all just sit back, watch and wait?||There has to be a way to stop Trump reneging on the pledges made by the US in Paris, to stop his denial of the problem and to force him to implement the necessary solutions. Otherwise we're all screwed. Period.
I know there will be many scientists, liberal politicians and environmental activists in the US protesting against the Trump plan. They are likely to be subjected to demonization and misinformation campaigns and it won't be enough - Trump & the GOP will do nothing unless some of the big corporations and the majority of American public opinion is against them. International governments may make protestations about US policy, but ultimately will do nothing, that's why it has to come from a grass roots movement.
Maybe there needs to be a campaign that calls for people to boycott goods and services provided by US companies in the UK; hopefully the campaign would spread to other countries. Boycotting all American companies would not be practical but there could be a small number targeted initially, such as Coca Cola, Pepsi, McDonald, Starbucks, KFC. This could become more encompassing as time went on until Trump gives in and changes tack.If the campaign took off and enough people were involved then Trump would be faced with enormous pressure at home from the big corporations and hopefully from public opinion when the American people realise how strong the feelings are in other countries about Trumps proposals.
Here in the UK, as with many countries we are not doing what we need to be doing to fully realise the targets we agreed to in Paris, but Trump is the only leader who says he is going to reject Paris and go full steam in the opposite direction; that, plus the size of the US and it's already high consumption levels and the effect that will have on the planet. In addition rather than other countries getting together to do more on climate, the US stance could give others an excuse to also renege. 
Also, if the campaign was successful it would put climate change in the spotlight and hopefully move it higher up the political agenda, and then the governments of those of us outside the US might feel pressured to do more.||Delegates have gathered in Marrakech

Swap Jenkinson, Elneny and Sanchez out for the absent Bellerin, Cazorla and Welbeck and suddenly you have a different set of players ready to go - a far more competent right back, the marshal of the pitch, and a fitter, more energetic forward than the jaded Sanchez. That would have raised Arsenal's game - their problem, to me at least, seemed to be the lethargy that swamped their offensive movement - making it very easy for United to crush any attacks and hold the ball for the majority of the game. We saw that when Arsenal had a genuine attack United looked weaker, and conceded - the quality Arsenal clearly have was too much. Good squad rotation and ensuring the players that start are fit and quality is what was absent today I feel - Wenger placed too much faith in the likes of Ramsey, Jenkinson and the unfit Sanchez to perform.
Having said that, give them tougher opposition than United and they'd have lost by more, so perhaps there are questions that need to be asked of Arsenal when they are missing Cazorla. He's the biggest absence IMO - you lose the effectiveness of your DMs and the forwards ahead of him by severing their greatest connection. And by default, the back line get weaker - hence why Koscielny looked the only fully functioning CB today. Take Cech out and you'd have seen United ahead far earlier than when they were.||Well, Mourinho should have let the game flow, for United were pinging the ball with purpose until Mata went off. Mou's ""shoring up the result"" tactics cost him - he missed Fellaini in such situations.
Strange from Wenger though, right until those substitutions.||I didn't see any kind of ""tug"" for the penalty shout, an arm across, definitely, but no tug.",,35230f7f-068a-49b6-a63a-df935f766695,,14,,,,,"<p>There was a good moment at the final whistle here. Arsène Wenger and José Mourinho shook hands brusquely on the Old Trafford touchline, turned to walk off, then realised with a shared prickle of awkwardness they were heading the same way, the world’s most awkward shared hundred metre stroll ahead of them. Wenger did the decent thing, taking a couple of paces then stopping and pretending to fiddle with his coat. It was deftly done and no doubt a sensible move, the thick black cloud above Mourinho’s head almost visible as he stalked off at the end of a 1-1 draw from which Manchester United really should have taken three points.</p> <p>Arsenal were lucky here.

People suffer when rapacious financial institutions put them in their cross hairs and of course the rest of the population (us) pay to bail out the banks.

I hope so; as deserved as his number 1 status is it won't really feel like he's cemented it unless he finally does the deed and beats Djokovic-- he hasn't faced him since Roland Garros and hasn't lost a single match since then. I hope he can do it.||Unbelievable. Just unbelievable.
You run out of superlatives to describe Andy Murray. He wasn't at his best today by any stretch but he still ground out the win. Hats off as well to Raonic who played out of his skin. His returning was superb. Don't think it will be too long until we see him holding a slam title.
As for tomorrow, we'll have to see what Andy has in the tank. It would be fitting to see a Murray Djokovic final with Murray prevailing. Would be the icing on the cake of his best ever season.

Arsenal needed it, though. They were outplayed by PSG for most of this 2-2 draw, overrun in midfield and flattered to escape with a point.</p> <p>In avoiding defeat they were indebted to a moment of stirring incision against the head from Özil, who has often been accused of disappearing in these big games. “As soon as there is physicality involved, Özil disappears,” Raymond Domenech, always good for a line, had announced on French TV before kick‑off. And this is how Özil has been cast by some: a man for the small occasion, the blunt end, those moments where the going gets smooth.</p>",Mesut Özil’s vision prevents Arsenal from drifting against PSG,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/nov/23/mesut-ozil-arsenal-psg-champions-league

One issue I have with your analysis is not that it’s too depressing, but overly sunny. You still frame recent events as setbacks on the otherwise inevitable march of progress towards a more interconnected, liberal, tolerant, eco-friendly, post-national egalitarian utopia.

The rich world has a choice of erecting fortress-like structures around itself, or accepting a steep decline of living standards combined with erasing old place-based identities. No one’s ready for that, so the fortress route looks inevitable.
After that, we confront the fact that there’s no bringing manufacturing back to the West, and no arresting or reversing the creep of automation. So high corporate taxes and Universal Basic Income seem like the way forward – by that point, the cost of disenfranchising people by the ten million, in the shape of populist revolts and instability, should outweigh the fear that high taxes will scare ‘wealth creators’ off to Asia. Plus they’ll be creating more wealth than ever, without their salary bills. 
This will further widen the massive gulf in living standards between the global rich and the rest, requiring an ever-stronger fortress, and a farewell to the dream of universal human rights. It was the right idea at the wrong time, and we can only hope that future generations of progressives have the luxury to pursue it.

Some of the problems you list could yet cancel each other out – the multiple blows the EU is due to receive, when it’s already on the ropes, may render the Brexit specifics irrelevant. If the EU fractures, the other European states will have crossed over into our brave old-new world. That will make any negotiations much easier, as they won’t be constrained by the need to publicly buttress their post-national ideology. 
One issue I have with your analysis is not that it’s too depressing, but overly sunny. You still frame recent events as setbacks on the otherwise inevitable march of progress towards a more interconnected, liberal, tolerant, eco-friendly, post-national egalitarian utopia. In that sense, you follow the intellectual dead-end most recently occupied by Hillary Clinton, and your old mate Blair. The prophet of the 1990s wasn’t Fukuyama, but John Grey. History is cyclical, and we’re entering a period where the old 1990s certainties have collapsed, replaced by the older certainties of the 1950s. 
The choice for progressives is to either go down with the ship (which has a certain death-before-dishonour appeal), or rethink some first principles. A global re-distribution of wealth on a historical scale is not going to happen in the foreseeable, so that means the perpetual migrant crisis will require a less idealistic, more immediately available answer. The rich world has a choice of erecting fortress-like structures around itself, or accepting a steep decline of living standards combined with erasing old place-based identities. No one’s ready for that, so the fortress route looks inevitable.
After that, we confront the fact that there’s no bringing manufacturing back to the West, and no arresting or reversing the creep of automation. So high corporate taxes and Universal Basic Income seem like the way forward – by that point, the cost of disenfranchising people by the ten million, in the shape of populist revolts and instability, should outweigh the fear that high taxes will scare ‘wealth creators’ off to Asia. Plus they’ll be creating more wealth than ever, without their salary bills. 
This will further widen the massive gulf in living standards between the global rich and the rest, requiring an ever-stronger fortress, and a farewell to the dream of universal human rights. It was the right idea at the wrong time, and we can only hope that future generations of progressives have the luxury to pursue it.
I don’t know the future, obviously, but I reckon it will get worse before it gets better.

Maybe they’d better put some zombies in the White House for political balance.</p> May’s shtick: Jam for some     ‘BBC news announcers are doing her PR for her by always slowing down on pronouncing this supposedly zeitgeisty catchphrase so that we can fully appreciate it, in all its piquant buzzphrasey-ness, and the fact that it spells jam!’ Photograph: Alamy    <p>Like celebrities who pick their own nicknames (such as Paul “The Guv’nor” Ince), politicians who try popularising their own catchphrases can find themselves on stony ground. John Major’s “back to basics” coincided with a flurry of sex scandals. Tony Blair’s New Labour tried us with the deeply annoying “big conversation”, that all-inclusive national debate which was abandoned after 9/11. And David Cameron gave it a go with his sensitive, volunteer-based “big society”, but later did not wish to discuss all those volunteer-run food banks. Theresa May is having more luck with her Middle England non-scroungers who are “just about managing”. BBC news announcers are doing her PR for her by always slowing down on pronouncing this supposedly zeitgeisty catchphrase so that we can fully appreciate it, in all its piquant buzzphrasey-ness, and the fact that it spells jam! The mingling of condescension and self-pity in this phrase is almost unbearable. I am just about managing not to lose my breakfast.</p>",It’s official – The Walking Dead helped elect Donald Trump ,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/23/walking-elect-dead-trump-immigration-zombies

(It comes from the US educator Alfie Kohn, so I’ll Britishise it here.) This man is elderly and lives near a school. Every afternoon a group of pupils subject him to merciless taunts as they walk home. So he approaches them and offers a deal: he’ll give each child £1 if they come back next day to taunt him further. Incredulous but excited, they agree. They return to mock him; he pays as promised, but tells them that the following day, he’ll only be able to afford to pay 25p per person. Still thrilled to be paid at all, the children are there again the next afternoon, whereupon the old man sadly explains that, henceforth, the daily reward for hurling abuse at him will be a mere 1p. “A penny?” The kids are scornful. For such pathetic money, it’s not worth the effort. They stalk off, grumbling, and never bother him again.</p> <p>The truth being exploited here – that rewards can backfire – isn’t new. Psychologists have studied it for years, and call it the “overjustification effect”. The traditional assumption was always that people worked essentially like BF Skinner’s lab rats: dangle an incentive, and you’ll train them to do what you want. But for humans, in certain conditions, the reward simply reinforces the belief that the task can’t be worth doing for itself. It locates all the pleasure in the future, when the reward will be bestowed, turning the present-moment doing into a grind. From this perspective, rewards aren’t the opposite of punishments, but basically the same thing: a way of pressuring people into performing activities you can’t rely on them wanting to do.</p>",Why rewards can backfire,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/nov/18/why-rewards-can-backfire-oliver-burkeman

To me it's Schrader's swansong||I've been on the lookout for ages for one of Schrader's films from around 2000, called Affliction. It had Nick Nolte and James Coburn; the latter was nommed for an oscar. Apparently that was a great movie with some fine performances. Also Blue Collar with Richard Pryor, Yaphet Kotto and Harvey Keitel was highly rated. 
Schrader was always a bit leftfield, but the best bad director seems a little harsh given his earlier works.At the very least, he will always be the writer of Taxi Driver.||I don't know who to believe on this- Bradshaw gives it four stars, but Kermode the other day slated it. I am inclined to think the latter can be too easily put off by a rather prudish sensibility when it comes to drugs and swearing. But then much of what I read about this film makes it sound like the worst sub-sub-Tarantino dreck of the kind that people stopped making in about 2003.||Schrader has all the qualifications for being a great director - except actually being a great director.||No reviewer seems able to get past the casting in discussing 'The Canyons'. The film's subject is the death of Hollywood as a place with any kind of creative ambition and its replacement by money-men who only understand making a quick buck out of cheap sensationalism. Schrader's subsequent films sound like they've been designed to illustrate his thesis.",,43cd31b4-7819-4164-a995-6670e855da1e,,8,,,,," <p> Related: Dog Eat Dog review – Willem Dafoe is magnificently needy in Paul Schrader's tasty thriller </p>   <p>Age is not mellowing 1970s wunderkind writer-director Paul Schrader one bit.

His Tyrion has proven to be one of telly's most memorable characters, inspired by the expert acting chops of Dinklage in a well-written role only party-defined by his dwarfism.
Get yourself a good agent. And if you have the chops, and a bit of luck, you may get more interesting roles.
Politically-correct casting isn't the way forward. People see through that and in the end the art can suffer for it. However I mostly agree with you that, as long as funds & availability permit, traditional dwarf characters are best played by dwarf actors. The physicality of the role is key.||Real dwarf actors are rare and therefore expensive but shouldn't be replaced with special effects of children, sounds rather like a protection racket||I remember watching the primordial dwarf from The Island of Dr Moreau and thinking, ""I bet Andre the Giant would have knocked that performance out of the park"".||"" Other disabilities are also experiencing this; look at Eddie Redmayne cast to portray Stephen Hawking in the recent biopic.

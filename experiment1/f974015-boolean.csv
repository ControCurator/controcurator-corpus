We have no idea what will happen to children who take puberty blockers for years for gender dysphoria - whether fertility will be affected for example. We should be wary of assuming that medication is the best way of treating gender dysphoria, especially as many children with early dysphoria choose to return to their birth gender when older.||There are no easy answers here. There's no doubt that people who do genuinely experience gender dysphoria go through hell, but it's also true that very young children don't have an understanding of surgery and medical procedures and are susceptible to parental influence. 
I found this bit particularly disturbing though. 

Whilst it's good that they're not being pushed into medical solutions, we seem to be going backwards. In the seventies and eighties it was positively fashionable to be be gender non conforming, now we seem to have reverted to 1950's ideas of feminity and masculinity. 
Why on earth does a gender non conforming teen end up in a clinic in the first place?||That's a worry. Every clinician should have doubts. Even surgeons have doubts, but not this bloke.

I agree that treatment shouldn't begin until adulthood and the cases of disturbance before that will lessen as parents and wider society come to terms with what is happening.||Looking back to my own childhood - a long time ago - I cannot say tht I ever wanted to be anything but a girl. As I was born as a girl that was OK, of course. But the fact of how it never occurred to me to look for an identity that was the real me makes the plight of chldren born into the wrong body (or even operated on at or shortly after birth to fulfil the wishes of parents who wanted a daughter but got a son) so much more intense. Now, the failure of nature to match psychological identity with physical characteristics can be helped by medicine and operative procedures that are far more acceptable than lives ruined by a lack of sympathy and understanding. The transgender issue has always been around. Religious bias is unhelpful and so is the unwillingness of some parents to accept the wishes of the child - and those wishes are not a fad. Dressing up as the 'opposite' gender is often the only tool a child has for that element of self-expression.

As Dr Polly Carmichael, current director of the service, observes, it was considered a career-limiting option for a clinical psychologist to specialise in the field of gender identity in young people – there weren’t enough patients. That is not how it has turned out. Last year, 1,400 children under 18 were referred to Gids, double the number the year before. Of these 1,400, nearly 300 were under the age of 12, with some as young as three years old.</p> <p>The reasons for this exponential increase are obviously complex. One factor seems to be a huge shift in awareness of transgender individuals in wider culture. The attention paid to Caitlyn Jenner in America, and Kellie Maloney here; a transgender actor, Riley Carter Millington, playing a transgender role in EastEnders; the historic tragedy of the story told in The Danish Girl and the many public controversies about respect for trans rights have all informed this awareness.</p>",Transgender children: the parents and doctors on the frontline,,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/nov/13/transgender-children-the-parents-and-doctors-on-the-frontline

We have no idea what will happen to children who take puberty blockers for years for gender dysphoria - whether fertility will be affected for example. We should be wary of assuming that medication is the best way of treating gender dysphoria, especially as many children with early dysphoria choose to return to their birth gender when older.||There are no easy answers here. There's no doubt that people who do genuinely experience gender dysphoria go through hell, but it's also true that very young children don't have an understanding of surgery and medical procedures and are susceptible to parental influence. 
I found this bit particularly disturbing though. 

Whilst it's good that they're not being pushed into medical solutions, we seem to be going backwards. In the seventies and eighties it was positively fashionable to be be gender non conforming, now we seem to have reverted to 1950's ideas of feminity and masculinity. 
Why on earth does a gender non conforming teen end up in a clinic in the first place?||That's a worry. Every clinician should have doubts. Even surgeons have doubts, but not this bloke.
There's a serious issue around the decision making capacity of minors which isn't addressed well in the article||We do have to at least acknowledge the possibility of dysphoria by proxy, that the recent court case showed.

To many they have apparently offered “a blissful, almost drugged-up break from reality”. But Kelly will pierce the “haze of preconceptions” obscuring Austen’s fiction. She will show us that, far from giving us “demure dramas in drawing rooms”, Austen used her novels to “examine the great issues of her day”. She will teach us to “read Jane’s novels … as she intended”.</p> <p>Her confidence that she has a special knowledge of these intentions is signalled in the opening section of each of her chapters, where she provides novelistic episodes in which “Jane” (always called so in this book) ponders the lowly status of women or the effects of rural poverty or the evils of slavery. These lead us into chapter-by-chapter treatment of each of the novels, revealing the importance of money in Sense and Sensibility, or the activities of the militia in Pride and Prejudice, or the possible effect of enclosures in Emma.

But I'm surprised Zoe Williams isn't aware of the darker origins of Cinderella's tiny feet. Daly's Gyn/Ecology (a pretty 'grim' feminist read from the seventies as I recall), makes it clear that it originates in China, and Cinders' tiny feet are the nightmare 'lotus hooks' of bound feet - in earlier versions of the story the ugly stepsisters actually cut off their own toes and heels in an attempt to make their over large feet fit into the glass slippers (lotus hooks).
The whole ouvre of fairy tales is far, far richer than a simple read! And capable of endless 'transversion'.

I guess that it is possible that he thinks (or at least part of him thinks) every time you attempt to touch him that you're going to want sex.
Either he's afraid of it because of his erectile dysfunction or because he just doesn't fancy the idea any more - or at least not with you. And so every attempt at touching is rebuffed and the intimacy that goes with it is lost.
And once the intimacy is lost, even conversations become dangerous lest the subject come round to why he won't touch you any more. It is easier to argue in order to avoid conversation.
It may not be possible to coax him back out of his shell. Certainly nothing you know how to try by yourself has managed it. Therefore Annalisa's suggestion of counselling is right and necessary. But be aware that you cannot force your husband to participate, and if he does, the answer you eventually get may not be the one you want.
But even that would not be the end of the world. It might signal the end of the relationship, but any counselling you have will involve you thinking about what you might do if the marriage does come to an end. Your mid 50s is by no means too old to start a new relationship.

Firstly, you aren't ""to blame"" for his lack of physical response to you, and thinking that you are is only going to compound your misery and make you feel worse.
I think you have already arrived at the solution though, which is good news. A break is needed - not one during which you look for affection elsewhere, but one in which you go for many long walks and have a good think.
I suggest you make arrangements to stay elsewhere - either by yourself or with a good friend / family member who is happy to give you some space to think - and then go away. Obviously leave a note to say that you're going, but there's no point debating this action beforehand.
Give yourself time, possibly for the first time in a long while, to think. See how it feels to be away from him, to spend significant amounts of time on your own. Go away for at least 4 nights, preferably a week. Make sure your note says that you are coming back, but don't indicate when.
See what your husband's reaction is when you return. Is he grateful to see you again ? Did he worry ? Did he contact your children or family to see where you were or how you were ? Or is he going to be cold and angry at you, caring only for the break in his routine and the absence of a cook and cleaner ?
It might be the jolt you both need, to kick-start conversations and plans and resolutions. That is what I would hope for the most. Or it could indicate, starkly, that your relationship is over in all but name.
What you do then is up to you. I know many people who are ""time serving"" in jobs and relationships just for the sake of the pension and the shared equity and they're not generally happy. You are unlikely to starve, whatever happens - you may need to cut your clothe more sparingly, but on the other hand other doors will be open that could give you what you need - and what, I would say, you deserve.

I suggest you make arrangements to stay elsewhere - either by yourself or with a good friend / family member who is happy to give you some space to think - and then go away. Obviously leave a note to say that you're going, but there's no point debating this action beforehand.
Give yourself time, possibly for the first time in a long while, to think. See how it feels to be away from him, to spend significant amounts of time on your own. Go away for at least 4 nights, preferably a week. Make sure your note says that you are coming back, but don't indicate when.
See what your husband's reaction is when you return. Is he grateful to see you again ? Did he worry ? Did he contact your children or family to see where you were or how you were ? Or is he going to be cold and angry at you, caring only for the break in his routine and the absence of a cook and cleaner ?
It might be the jolt you both need, to kick-start conversations and plans and resolutions. That is what I would hope for the most. Or it could indicate, starkly, that your relationship is over in all but name.

I wonder how many couples end up like this. Unfortunately it is not easy to walk away.||He has got into this habit of thought. I guess that it is possible that he thinks (or at least part of him thinks) every time you attempt to touch him that you're going to want sex.
Either he's afraid of it because of his erectile dysfunction or because he just doesn't fancy the idea any more - or at least not with you. And so every attempt at touching is rebuffed and the intimacy that goes with it is lost.
And once the intimacy is lost, even conversations become dangerous lest the subject come round to why he won't touch you any more. It is easier to argue in order to avoid conversation.
It may not be possible to coax him back out of his shell. Certainly nothing you know how to try by yourself has managed it. Therefore Annalisa's suggestion of counselling is right and necessary. But be aware that you cannot force your husband to participate, and if he does, the answer you eventually get may not be the one you want.
But even that would not be the end of the world. It might signal the end of the relationship, but any counselling you have will involve you thinking about what you might do if the marriage does come to an end. Your mid 50s is by no means too old to start a new relationship.
Good luck!||That's why the good lord created extramarital affairs. Not even spending evenings together is a clear indication that the generic solution ""why don't you talk it all out?"" offered (in the article will be neither easy nor effective.||Have a few sex-buddies and enjoy yourself.||Goodness me, I feel for you - so much pain and longing.

The staleness of the coaching set up has drummed a lot out of the individuality out of the players. Would someone like Shane get in now, or would the coaches prefer another behemoth on the wing?
I sometimes feel discussing long term issues is a smokescreen for letting current coaches off the hook, as with the discussion of long-term issues (e.g. 7s) after England got knocked out of the RWC 2015. 
Howley has been attack (sic) coach for a number of years during which the Welsh attack has become ever more predictable - keep going round the corner, use big ball carriers, seek contact rather than space, kick long but keep in play (ELV style) etc. 
The current coaching set up haven't developed the style of play from that which was effective (in the NH anyway) around 2011-13 and haven't brought through new players either. The Welsh team of 2005, while frail and vulnerable, played heads up rugby and was capable of great spontaneity, with Shane, Henson etc. …||The coaching staff have drilled them like robots. Now they have been 'let off the leash' it's now the players fault it hasn't worked.

Poor old Duckett, out at sea and the most unselectable of players since Finn was the recipient of some of the worst man management ever seen in a calamitous tour of Australia* (some competition there too). No doubt Duckett will learn, and will return.
I hope Joe Root is hurting, because he was largely responsible for the fine mess we got into in the first innings, but he is a great player and will bounce back.
The series defeat in Bangladesh underlined what we already knew; England have a brilliant spine, but beyond that only phantom limbs.

If Scotland doesn't beat them tonight, I'll be really surprised.||Broony can GTF. You don't get to pick and choose what games you play in.||I feel Strachan is not really in charge of the team, Brown is.
For a long time, the Scottish national team has been dictated to by players from both Glasgow clubs, who consider themselves and their tedious rivalry to be of more importance.
Brown should never have been allowed back. He quit. Game over. Strachan has zero authority. McGhee patronises the nation.
For the first time in my life, I hope Scotland lost heavily tonight, so that we can dispense with these hopeless chancers.
However, the chances of any general improvement after that are extremely slim, since his successor will be chosen by the same clueless blazers who installed Strachan and gave him a new contract for abject failure in finishing 4th out of 6 teams.
None of these sinister men in brown brogues ever have to answer to anyone and sort everything out by committee and funny handshakes.
Basically we are stuck in the dark ages, and will be for the foreseeable.

He was particularly scathing about the Romans version, and hadn't bothered with Mozzers.||I always thought they were the best thing since the Beatles and their music would age the same way. 
I listened to Hatful of Hollow last week. Alas it hasn't aged well, and I wondered why I thought so much of it. Revolver, Rubber Soul have never dimmed.||I dip back into the Smiths periodically and find that time hasn't tarnished them.

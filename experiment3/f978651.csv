He was young once, of course, but the world never saw much of the modestly successful poet and novelist from Montreal. He was already 33 — ancient by 60s standards — when he gazed out from the sepia-tinted, photo-booth snapshot on the cover of 1967’s Songs of Leonard Cohen with his shirt, tie and smart side-parting. The face suggested that he’d been around the block a few times; the voice and words confirmed it. The man knew things about life and if, you listened closely, you might learn something.</p> <p>The truth was that Cohen felt as lost as anybody. What gave his work its uncommon gravitas wasn’t that he knew the answers but that he never stopped looking. He searched for clues in bedrooms and warzones, in Jewish temples and Buddhist retreats, in Europe, Africa, Israel and Cuba. He tried to flush them out with booze and drugs and seduce them with melodies. And whenever he managed to painfully extract some nugget of wisdom, he would cut and polish it like a precious stone before resuming the search. Funny about himself but profoundly serious about his art, he liked to describe his songs as “investigations” into the hidden mechanics of love, sex, war, religion and death – the beautiful and terrifying truths of existence. A Leonard Cohen song is an anchor flung into a churning sea. It has the kind of weight that could save your life.<br /></p>","Leonard Cohen – he knew things about life, and if you listened you could learn",article,https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2016/nov/11/leonard-cohen-he-knew-things-about-life-and-if-you-listened-you-could-learn

The ups: its warmth on a cold day, a bowl in my hands like a morning hot-water bottle, the quick but nourishing time spent stirring at the stove, a welcome interruption and a few minutes to let my mind wander at the start of the day. The downside: I can’t eat porridge on a hot day: it just feels wrong. I’ve never understood those who eat it like clockwork, regardless of the temperature. I used to struggle with the monotonous texture of porridge, I wanted each spoonful to be different and interesting.

But Szubanski is entirely unaffected, immediately forthcoming and soothingly at ease. “This is all a bit My Fair Lady, isn’t it? I could bloody murder a sarnie,” she announces, before charming the waitress – also a Magda – with a brief but effusive exchange in Polish. “I do have to be careful,” she says afterwards. “I’m too good at accents, so when I speak other languages, people always assume I speak it better than I do.”</p> <p>That ear for voices and eye for appearances has fuelled Szubanski’s astonishing roll call of iconic performances over 30 years. Perhaps her most famous, certainly overseas, is the ungainly “second best friend” Sharon Strzelecki in Kath &amp; Kim.

For a more recent glassblowing poet, Peter Goldsworthy, the glassblower’s deft, precarious and delicate operations form a mirror of the poet’s craft in Glass. Goldsworthy’s poem comes to rest on a pun on the word “still”; the blower forms a vessel of that name, but the timeless stillness of the best glassware is also present. Exploring similar territory, Thomas W Shapcott’s The Glass Vase stands outside time and place, and its great value is that it is breakable, that it stands for the fragility of “the thing made”, which is life itself.</p>",Poster poems: glass,article,https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2016/nov/11/poster-poems-glass-poetry-share-your-verse

The earliest known manufactured glass objects are from Mesopotamia, and were made about 5,000 years ago. For most of the intervening period, glass was a luxury item, used for jewellery and expensive tableware. It must have seemed somewhat miraculous: a transparent, malleable, yet rigid substance, something between rock, water and air. Of course, these very properties have made glass a rich source of imagery for poets.</p> <p>Glassblowing is an ancient art, as reflected in this Greek poem found on a third century Egyptian scroll that reflects the quasi-divine nature of the material.

The dramatist spends a lot of time in the ladies’, not from nerves but because she has found that “you hear really honest responses if you just sit in a cubicle and listen”. At a preview of Chimerica, her epic drama about US-Asia relations, she overheard an Almeida theatregoer say, “Oh God, it’s three hours long. I was hoping to be home for Grand Designs!” It made the writer panic, but the production transferred to the West End and won four best play awards.</p> <p> Whatever the lavatorial feedback on The Children, about to open at the Royal Court in London, Kirkwood has been unusually thoughtful to her audience with the choice of title. Few were sure how to pronounce Chimerica (the first syllable, she says, should rhyme with whine not him), while no one could remember the name of It Felt Empty When the Heart Went at First But It Is Alright Now, her breakthrough play about sex trafficking.</p>",Chimerica playwright Lucy Kirkwood: 'The whole of democracy looks fragile and farcical',article,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/nov/14/lucy-kirkwood-the-children-royal-court-theatre-chimerica

A poet and novelist as well as a songwriter, Cohen, who has died aged 82, was as much a literary figure as a musical one.</p> <p> Early in his career, his novel Beautiful Losers (1966) caused the Boston Globe to declare that “James Joyce is not dead. He is living in Montreal under the name of Cohen.” Yet Cohen was determined to establish himself as a songwriter, having been smitten as profoundly as any of his contemporaries by the emergence of rock’n’roll. “I always loved rock,” he said. “I remember the first time I heard Presley, how relieved and grateful I was that all this stuff he and all of us had been feeling for so long had finally found a particular kind of expression.” </p>",Leonard Cohen obituary,article,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/nov/11/leonard-cohen-obituary

One of the best bands Ever.Jello for president NOW!",,582a3008e4b0eb4ebf2740a4,,11,,,,2016-11-16T12:07:55Z,music,,"1. California Über Alles  <p>The debate over what exactly constitutes “punk” is a long and thorny one. Is it a sound? An attitude? Sitting squarely across it are California’s Dead Kennedys, a band punk enough to feature in Rolling Stone’s 40 greatest punk albums but who employed elements of surf guitar, jazz, poetry and even bolero across four studio albums of biting wit, fury and pristine pop songs. Thiss debut single exemplifies their complicated musical relationship with punk. Singer Jello Biafra’s lyrics – a blistering attack on the then governor of California, Jerry Brown (who returned to the post in 2011), which reference the now-unused first stanza of the German national anthem – and Klaus Flouride’s ominous bass riff are typical of the 1979 punk scene into which the song was released. And yet other elements of California Über Alles shy away from the stereotypes of punk rock. Bruce Slesinger’s drums combines a bolero rhythm with militaristic rolls – guitarist East Bay Ray called the song “our Wagnerian piece with a bolero rhythm” – while the opening guitar lines have shades of the gothic surf-rock style that Ray brought to the group.</p>            2. Holiday in Cambodia <p>California Über Alles was followed a year later by Holiday in Cambodia, a masterclass in atmospherics. The opening 20 seconds of rattling bass and sparse, echoing guitar create a mood of musical paranoia that ratchets up several notches with the introduction of the drums, playing a frantic discoesque beat, and a guitar riff that brings to mind Dick Dale playing on as the Titanic slips under the water. The lyrics, meanwhile, are among Biafra’s best, a vicious dissection of the stereotypical college student who has “been to school for a year or two and you know you’ve seen it all”. But what might be most striking about Holiday in Cambodia is how many ideas it packs into its brief running time. In the 3min 43sec single version the song includes two intros, two verses, two rousing choruses, an eerie bridge, a guitar solo, an escalating middle eight and a final chorus, each brilliantly tarred with an air of creeping menace. It’s like all of the good bits of most punk bands compressed into three and a half minutes. The album version adds an ambient guitar intro for good measure, extending the running time to 4min 38sec.</p>",Dead Kennedys – 10 of the best,article,https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2016/nov/16/dead-kennedys-10-of-the-best

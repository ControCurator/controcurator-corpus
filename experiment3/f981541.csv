There was no great novelty to match the inaugural visit to Twickenham last week, none of the ‘home team’ narrative that can be spun each year when the Jaguars come to town. It was just two middling teams fighting to stay relevant this season.</p> <p>Yet it was two teams who would go on to produce one of the best games London has seen. There have been plenty of high-scoring occasions here at Wembley and certainly some dramatic final acts. But for a blend of entertainment and quality Cincinnati Bengals’ 27-27 tie with Washington – the first stalemate in the 10-year history of the International Series – was equalled perhaps only by the Minnesota Vikings’ triumph against the Pittsburgh Steelers in 2013.</p>",Washington and Cincinnati delight Wembley crowd in entertaining tie,article,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/30/nfl-washington-cincinnati-delight-wembley-crowd-entertaining-tie

It hasn’t been there in any of Alicia Vikander’s Louis Vuitton romantic, softly scoop-necked gowns, on the premiere tour of The Light Between Oceans. It wasn’t there on the best-dressed lists of the Met Gala in May, which were dominated by Beyoncé in high-necked skin-toned latex. It didn’t happen at Cannes, where Bella Hadid slayed all pretenders to her fashion throne in a red satin dress with a deep V to the waist, the smooth line from navel to waist accentuated by her swept-up hair. It was nowhere to be seen at the Oscars, where Jennifer Lawrence’s black lace Dior gown was free of obvious cantilevering.</p>     Bella Hadid at Cannes. Photograph: Samir Hussein/WireImage    <p>“Whatever happened to the cleavage?” asks the new issue of Vogue. The squished-together, hoicked-up presentation of bosoms has all but vanished from fashionable circles. Scaffolding breasts under the chin and framing them with a low-cut top, which has for decades been a shorthand for allure – the four-four-two of getting dressed up for a night out, if you like – is over. The go-to after dark neckline from catwalk to high street this year is a straight horizontal line that exposes the shoulders. The must-have Gucci blouses on Net-a-Porter have elaborate pussy bows that demand to be fastened around the neck. Any self-respecting It girl of the moment knows that the photo the paparazzi want is the one in gym leggings and a crop top, exposing this year’s must-have ab-crack. Eva Herzigová, whose 1994 Wonderbra advert (“Hello Boys”) did more than any other image to put cleavage at the bullseye of sex appeal, has this year chosen for her most high-profile appearances a pie-crust collared white blouse under a trouser suit for the Vogue centenary party, and a buttoned-up denim coord at the Venice film festival. I think we can safely call that a goodbye.</p>",The end of the cleavage: breasts piled together like cream buns do not make a subtle statement,article,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/nov/01/end-of-the-cleavage-bras-70s-boob-comeback

I hope he's banned for a long time.||I thought it was a brilliant finish by Zebo: not fortunate at all. He later stopped Hughes from scoring from a very similar but easier opportunity.||Munster played great - the Earls tackle was a low point - it deserved the red - rugby needs to stamp that type of tackle out of the game - The Munster team lifted themselves after the tragic death of Axel - This was a fine tribute to their Munster legend - The Munster fans were fantastic..",,fafe0b34-a243-48ca-a830-8b1e349e5f40,,18,,,,2016-10-22T15:38:38Z,sport,,"<p>In the old days, before Thomond Park was remodelled, we would come down here on freezing winter nights to be enthralled by the sight of glamour teams being beaten out the gate.

There has been an enormous amount of publicity for this documentary, with praise for Phillips’ clearly heartfelt intentions. The actor has an adorable young son, Olly, who has Down’s syndrome, and one of her aims is to provide a counterbalance to the almost entirely negative depiction of Down’s syndrome in both society and the media. For this, she should be loudly applauded. True, her wholly positive depiction of her life with a child with Down’s syndrome is as partial as the wholly negative ones, not least because her son is relatively high-functioning and Phillips and her husband are able to afford help. Still, as I said, it’s a much-needed corrective, and hats off to her.</p>","Sorry, Sally Phillips, but a woman should be able to know if her unborn baby has Down’s syndrome",article,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/06/sally-phillips-woman-unborn-baby-downs-terminate-pregnancy

Hollander's a brave man to follow John Wood!||I wonder if this production will transfer to a West End theatre, succeeding, in this regard, where The Hard Problem failed.||It is such a shame that the Menier's prices exclude so many. I know they are invariably always sold out, but it is one of the few things I dislike about this venue. That and its lack of front of house staff and the stinky toilets.||Worth every penny: brilliant production. In such a small and intimate theatre, every word can be heard. You could pay as much in the West End for a seat in the gods.||Enjoyed this on first preview night. 4 stars about right. £30 is a good price, and builds in the risk of the show being a dud. Mernier productions are generally a good bet. Facilities are OK for a small theatre.",,fdf6aca9-cbc5-404d-bdff-2e04cad7c31a,,9,,,,2016-10-05T10:38:22Z,stage,,"<p>Tom Hollander, as we know from from his TV performances in Rev and The Night Manager, is a highly versatile actor. But I was a touch apprehensive about seeing him play Henry Carr in Tom Stoppard’s Travesties, since John Wood’s performance in the original 1974 production is one of the highlights of my theatregoing life. I needn’t have worried, since Hollander brings his own brand of spry mischief to the role and Stoppard’s play has lost none of its champagne fizz and buoyant energy.</p> <p>Stoppard’s play starts from the fact that Carr, a minor consular official in Zurich in 1917, not only played Algernon in The Importance of Being Earnest for the English Players, but was also involved in angry litigation with the company’s business manager, James Joyce. We see the aged Carr fallibly recalling the experience. More crucially, since Lenin and the dadaist founder, Tristan Tzara, were in Zurich at the same time as Joyce, Carr imagines he himself was a pivotal player in the political, artistic and literary revolutions that were to shape the 20th century.<br /></p>",Travesties review – Hollander makes mischief in Stoppard's serious comedy,article,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/oct/05/travesties-review-tom-hollander-tom-stoppard-patrick-marber
